i learnt today something about the access Modiefer ther are some point which i dont want top forget thats why i mawritting it down

there are 4 typr of access modiefier in java 
1. private
2. protected
3.<default>
4.public

Private:
------------------------
private is also known as ristricted access modfire 
--->we can not access private method variable from the out of the clas

---->a class can not acces even by creatring its object

---->private memeber are only available within the class
---->>> For outer Class private temninology uis not applicable if we trying to make a outer class private the definatly a error will accor
------>if a class extend the other class which have some private member then also it can not be available for the sub class
-
Protected:
------------------
protected are available with in the class and also available within the pacakage we can access them by simply creating the object 

procted mewmbner are the always available for its dub class 

protected members are avail for other package only if that pacakge's class is the the sub class

 For outer Class private temninology uis not applicable if we trying to make a outer class private the definatly a error will accor
 
 <default>
 ----------------------------------
 
 
default access modiefier are also known as package specifier we can accesse them by creating the object of the class then by that object 
we can accese te default member of the class

for class level there are availabilty to make a class a default class But there are no syntax of default:
exaple:
class a
{
  ----
  -----
}
this class will be refer as the default class and it will be avaiable with in the package

PUBLIC:
--------------------

public is accsessable from any where No matter we are in the pacakage or we are in the other package we vcan use 
the public member by simple creating the the object of that class 

---->there no ristriction for public member even if a class is not sub class of that class which has the Public member we can use 
them.


this is all about wat i learn today........
